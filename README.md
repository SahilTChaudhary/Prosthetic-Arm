# ABSTRACT

Prosthetic Arms can be a life changer for those unfortunate enough to lose an arm. However, they can be quite expensive and hence inaccessible to the general masses. The idea behind the project was to design and develop a cost-effective Prosthetic Arm. The cost was reduced by using less material to make the structure of the arm. Topology Optimization was performed to determine the non-critical portions of the structure, and hence remove them. This reduced the material used and hence reduced the cost. The functional prototype was made using 3-D Printing and Raspberry Pi 4.

# CONCLUSION

Topology Optimization was successfully used to reduce the material cost of the arm. However, considering that the arm has been 3-D Printed using ABS, it is relatively weak, and can only be utilized for manipulating light objects like soda cans, stationery etc. Strength can be improved by either changing the material, or changing the manufacturing method, both of which will increase cost.
